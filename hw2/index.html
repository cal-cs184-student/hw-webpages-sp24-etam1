<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment, I developed a mesh editor that can execute many mesh operations like split, subdivide, and flip. 
  With the implementation of Bezier curves and understanding of de Casteljau’s algorithm, I then expanded 
  its functionality to implement Bezier surfaces. In addition, I also experienced the manipulation of triangle meshes utilizing 
  the half-edge data structure while also integrating area-weighted vertex normals to facilitate shading that's more smooth. 
  I also created functionalities like edge flipping and edge splitting which are very useful for the implementation loop subdivision. 
  In all, I crafted a functional mesh editor with features 
  like area-weighted vertex normals, edge flipping, edge splitting, and mesh upsampling functionalities.

  In this assignment, I got to look at mesh handling within 3D modeling and animation software, 
  like Maya and Blender. Because of this, I now better understand the calculations made behind each mesh subdivision, edge manipulation, and the data structures in these software.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  De Caseljau’s algorithm is an algorithm that goes through multiple recursive steps. In part 1, I use the parameter t and the control points n to add an edge and a point using linear interpolation. Now, if I were to repeat these steps through recursion, we can see that the points will converge to a single point that is guaranteed to be on the Bezier curve given the parameter t, which is used to define our final curve. 
  To implement Casteljau's algorithm, I started by creating an empty Vector2D object that will store the n-1 intermediate control points (given the t value) in the next subdivision level. I used a for loop to go through all n control points and use linear interpolation ((1 - t) * points[i]) + (t * points[i + 1]) to get an intermediate control point from the next subdivision. Now it should be noted that I didn’t linearly interpolate p sub n because n sub (n+1) doesn’t exist for the computation. Everytime we go through the loop, we want to push_back the result of ((1 - t) * points[i]) + (t * points[i + 1]) to our immediate control points and return our vector after we finish looping.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  Like the Bezier curves from part 1, de Casteljau's algorithm can also be applied to Bezier surfaces by iterating through an n x n grid of control point vectors through recursive procedures. This time we use two parameters, parameters u and v. Each row in the n x n grid has a collection of control points that defines a Dezier curve at parameter u, meaning implementing de Casteljau's algorithm on every row in the n x n grid will create n Bezier curves and a vector of n evaluated points, forming a “moving curve” in the 2D space. And by employing 1D de Casteljau facilitates, we can evaluate the Bezier curve represented by the “moving curve” at the given v value, giving us a point that lies on the Bezier surface (in 3D space).
</p>

<p>
To implement the Casteljau algorithm so it works on Bezier surfaces, I implemented the functions, evaluateStep(...), evaluate1D(...), and evaluate(...). For the function evaluateStep(...), the implementation is similar to the logic of part 1 but this time, the intermediate control points were stored in Vector3D objects. To implement evaluate1D(...), I called evaluateStep in a while loop, terminating when the evaluateStep returns a vector that is of size 1. The Vector3D element was given by returning and retrieving the element in the 0 index in the vector that is given by evaluateStep. The evaluate(...) method initialization establishes a Vector3D object that encompasses the moving curve points (single points evaluated at each Bezier curve). In this method, I also use a for loop that ranges from 0 to n with each iteration calling evaluate1D with the parameters u and the control point at index i. This evaluate(...) process will give us the single final point in the i-th row. At the final step of this method, we call evaluate1D one more time with the vector of moving curve points and v value to return the surface point.

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  To compute area-weighted vertex normals, we first create a Vector3D object with zeros in order to sum the weighted normals of each face connected to the vertex. I then call halfedge() to get the starting halfedge. Next, I use a do-while loop, to go through each incident halfedge stopping when we reach the starting halfedge.  Each iteration, I checked if the halfedge’s face was in the boundary as we only needed to consider halfedges that have non-boundary faces. To calculate the weighted normal of every single face, we did the cross product with two edge vectors and then divided the product by 2. To do this, we get the positions of every vertex forming the triangle. We got all three vertices by getting the corresponding vertex and its position using the current halfedge then going to the next halfedge (halfedge->next). I did this a total of 3 times (note that I didn’t halfedge->next on the third time) to get all 3 vertices’ positions. Using these positions, I did the cross product on two edge vectors which is calculated using (vector2 - vector1 and vector3 - vector1) and then normalizing the vector and dividing it by two to find the face’s area. I then multiplied the calculated area and the normal of the face and added the product to the Vector3D I created in the beginning to keep track of the sum of weighted normals. Now how I proceed to the next iteration is by setting my current halfedge the twin because we ran around the triangle and are currently on the other side of it (the haldedge connects to a new triangle yet to be explored).  Once the loop terminates because we reach the original starting half edge, we will have calculated the sum of all area-weighted normals of the faces connected to the given vertex. I then called .normalize() on the variable with all the area-weighted normals summed to get the final result to return.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  In this method, the edge flip operation will receive an edge and flip it, returning an iterator to the flipped edge. To implement this, I know that we have to return the input edge immediately if any of the faces connected to the given edge is on the boundary. If it’s not on the boundary we can proceed with our edge flip operation. To do an edge flip, I first drew out an example of a triangle mesh and assigned variables to each element in the diagram drawn. In total we have HalfedgeIters (halfedges) from h0, h1, ..., h9, VertexIters (vertex) from v0, ..., v3, EdgeIter (edges) from e1, ..., e4, and FaceIters from f0 and f1. I then drew out what I think the triangle mesh should look like after the flipping, rearranging any variables needed to depict the diagram. Looking at the new diagram, I reassigned each halfedge, vertex, edge, and face struct pointers then used setNeighbors() to set every halfedge with the the new twin halfedge pointer, the new vertex pointer, the new face pointer, and  the new edge pointer. Finally I set all vertex, edge, and face, to its new corresponding halfedge pointer.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>

<p>
  One thing I struggled with the most when debugging this part of the assignment was figuring out why my code is running infinitely or why are there triangle meshes deleted. To solve this and debug this, what I found really useful was to comment out parts of my code to see if it still errors. Even if it’s not supposed to output the correct result, I can see if the code I commented out was causing the issue, whether it’s a runtime issue or a failure in variable assignment.  
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  The edge split operation splits the given edge creating a cross and returning an iterator to the new vertex that’s inserted in the intersection of the cross. Like my edge flip operation, I tested if the inputted EdgeIter is on the boundary and returned the VertexIter of the edge if it’s the case. If not, I proceeded with the split operation. Like part 4, I drew out what the triangle mesh should look like before and after and assigned the mesh elements to variables in my images. When we split an edge, there are new elements created (6 new halfedges, 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 2 new faces). I then returned the new vertex created. To calculate this new vertex, I got the midpoint of the original edge which is calculated by adding the position vectors of v0 and v1 and dividing it by 2. With the result I set that to the new vertex and reassigned all the pointers of the mesh elements to their corresponding halfedge. As for debugging, I use the same method mentioned in my part 4.

  My debugging journey for part 5 is similar to that of part 4 where I commented out parts of my code to see how my teapot model will look and if it behave the way its suppose. By doing this, I was able to pinpoint the problem in my code that kept it running infinitely and crashing.  
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  To implement loop subdivision I first calculated the position and vertices new and old of the original mesh. With the old vertices, I went through all the vertices in the input mesh with a for loop and calculated the sum of the original positions of its neighboring vertices. To calculate the sum of original positions, I added the original positions to an empty Vector3D variable every iteration of the for loop. In addition, I factored in the current vertex’s original position. For that I used two variables, n (degree) and u (weight). If the n is 3 then, u is 3/16. If not, u is 3/8n.U Using u and n, I calculated the new position of each old vertex with (1.0 - n * u) * v->position + u * newPosition. I then assigned the result to the newPos variable of the current vertex. In addition, I also set the isNew attribute to be false for every vertex created. I then traverse through all the edges of the new vertices obtaining the surrounding vertices A and B (connected to the shared edge) and C and D (the other two). I then calculated the position of the new vertex with 3.0 / 8.0 * (A + B) + 1.0 / 8.0 * (C + D). I then assigned the result to the current edge’s newPosition attribute. And again, I set the isNew attribute of the new edges to be false. Then I sub divided the original mesh but doing edge splits then edge flips. To do edge splits, I first iterate through the edges in the mesh. If the edge and the edge’s adjacent vertices are not new, I split the edge and got the current position of the new vertex. I then assigned the result to the current edge’s newPostion attribute. In addition, I marked all the new edges with false isNew properties (excluded the created edge is aligned with the original edge). Then I did edge flips by iterating through all edges and checking if the edge is new, flipping the edge if it’s new. I then update every vertex position in the new subdivided mesh by iterating through all vertices and assigning it with its new position in its newPosition attribute.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  After performing several loop subdivision, I see that sharp edges are more smooth and round. The sharp corners and edges seem to recede into the mesh.

<p>
  This weird effect is created because new vertex positions on sharp edges were calculated using neighboring vertex 
  positions that differed significantly from each other. And because of this, the weighted 
  averages are substantially different. To fix this issue, we can pre-split edges.

<p>
  To make sure that the cube comes out with symmetric subdivisions, I pre-processed the cube by splitting all diagonal edges on each face (6 in total). The cube was asymmetric before because each of the 6 faces had only one edge splitting it and when I subdivided it, it divides unequally. Pre-processing the cube by splitting the edges on each flat face created symmetry, with two edges along each face. This allows the subdivision to look equal and symmetrical.
